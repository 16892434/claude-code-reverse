  "purpose": "This code snippet is a polyfill for the Web Streams API, specifically focusing on the ReadableStream, WritableStream, and related interfaces like ReadableStreamDefaultReader, ReadableStreamBYOBReader, WritableStreamDefaultWriter, and ReadableStreamController. It provides implementations for creating, reading from, writing to, and controlling streams of data in JavaScript environments that may not natively support the Web Streams API. The code includes functionalities for handling backpressure, managing queues, encoding/decoding data, and dealing with errors and abort signals."
