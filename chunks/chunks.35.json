  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be a combination of two open-source libraries: highlight.js and dotenv. \n\n*   **highlight.js:** The majority of the code seems to be related to highlight.js, a syntax highlighter for the web. It includes code for language definition, code highlighting, and HTML output.\n*   **dotenv:** The code also includes dotenv, a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into `process.env`. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.\n\nIn summary, the code snippet provides functionality for syntax highlighting and environment variable management."
