  "purpose": "This code snippet is part of the React DevTools backend. It's responsible for inspecting React components, extracting hook information, and communicating this data to the DevTools extension. It includes functionalities for:\n\n1.  **Hook Inspection:**  It uses React's internal APIs (through `__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED`) and a custom dispatcher to simulate rendering a component and collect information about the hooks used within it (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.).\n2.  **Stack Frame Parsing:** It parses stack traces to determine the location of hook calls within the component's source code.\n3.  **Data Serialization:** It serializes the hook data and component information for transmission to the DevTools frontend.\n4.  **Error Handling:** It handles errors that occur during component inspection and provides more informative error messages.\n5.  **Proxying React Internals:** It uses a Proxy to intercept calls to React's dispatcher, allowing it to track hook usage.\n6.  **Component Inspection Utilities:** Provides functions to inspect hooks of a Fiber (internal React data structure representing a component instance)."
