  "purpose": "This code appears to be a part of the 'ws' (WebSocket) library, a popular Node.js module for implementing WebSocket clients and servers. It includes functionalities for:\n\n1.  **Emoji Regular Expression:**  The first part defines a complex regular expression to match various emoji characters and sequences, including skin tone modifiers and combined emojis.\n2.  **Duplex Stream Handling:**  The second part provides a utility function to create a duplex stream from a WebSocket connection, allowing data to be read from and written to the socket using standard stream APIs.\n3.  **Constants and Utilities:**  The third part defines constants related to binary data types, WebSocket GUID, and other utility functions.\n4.  **Buffer Manipulation:**  The fourth part includes functions for concatenating, masking, and converting between different buffer types (Buffer, ArrayBuffer, etc.).\n5.  **Concurrency Limiter:**  The fifth part implements a concurrency limiter to control the number of asynchronous operations running in parallel.\n6.  **Per-Message Deflate Extension:**  The sixth part implements the permessage-deflate WebSocket extension for compressing and decompressing data frames.\n7.  **UTF-8 Validation and Blob Handling:**  The seventh part provides functions for validating UTF-8 encoded strings and handling Blob objects.\n8.  **WebSocket Frame Processing:**  The eighth part implements a class for parsing WebSocket frames, handling fragmentation, compression, and control messages.\n9.  **WebSocket Frame Sending:**  The ninth part implements a class for constructing and sending WebSocket frames, including masking and compression.\n10. **Event Handling:** The tenth part implements the basic event handling for WebSocket, including the definition of `CloseEvent`, `ErrorEvent`, `Event`, `EventTarget`, `MessageEvent`.\n11. **Header Parsing and Formatting:** The eleventh part implements the parsing and formatting of HTTP headers, specifically for WebSocket extensions.\n12. **WebSocket Client and Server Implementation:** The twelveth part implements the core WebSocket client and server functionality, including connection establishment, data transfer, and closing the connection.\n13. **Subprotocol Parsing:** The thirteenth part implements the parsing of WebSocket subprotocols.\n14. **WebSocket Server Class:** The fourteenth part implements the WebSocket server class, handling client connections and upgrades."
